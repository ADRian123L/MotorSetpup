    The program is an object meant to control a vehicle.
    The object can fully control a vehicle (wheels, encoders, speed, and 
    direction)
    When the object is initiated it asks for the pins, and the wheel's orientation.
    Then with a method the vehicle's speed and direction can be changed.
